Explored Library in Java and to focus on the database

We need to copied out
Top-Down mechanism
How? By minimizing the methods to see what type of methods we have

What is URL (Uniform Resource Locator)?
The resource is in our desktop... 

1. jdbc:derby:CoffeeDB;create=true

 jdbc using javs to use 
derby -> library
CoffeeDB -> DB we are manipulating
create=trie -> if doesnt exist create


2. Connection
  Connection conn =
                DriverManager.getConnection(DB_URL);
	
	DriverManager -> get the driveManager and connection to the DB location
	
3. If the DB exist drop the tables 

1. Get Statement Object
2. try use stmt.execite(QUERY); 



Package dependency can be different make sure we work on same environment

Now we use derby Library Import it how?
JRE Systsem Library -> Build Path -> Config new Path 
-> Add Jar -> AddExternal -> DerbyJar

---
GO through code Like this
CreateCoffee -> ShowCoffee - > JFrameDB -> SwingDBDemo

FRAME REALLY INTERESTING!!
How to verify valid before sending query to database connection??

ButtonGroup
ArrayList<JRadioButton> customerbutton= new ArrayList<JRadioButton>();
submit.addActionListener(this);
cancel.addActionListener(this);
Enumeration<AbstractButton> allRadioButton=customerGroup.getElements();  

//  Read a file
//  Put into array List
// 


A car what is the color and details....
Few option and select 

Course Registration
File of student records what you have taken what are the avai course
Minimum requrement you need to take...
Read the file and create GUI



WE have inserted some records 


1. Create connection
2.ArrayList because we dont know how many

3. now we knpow how many array so we make loop
4. Put in loop
5.Connectin close, 
6.statement close



FINAL EXAM ON DATABASE
NO DATABASE WORKING ON for DB access
Practice quesstion for DB? 
CREATE GUI

-------
Summarize: 
- GUI in final exam
- RadioButton -> JList

if you need radiobutton alot use buttonGroup...
-ActionListener, ItemListener, MouseListener? 
-File access StreamReader StreamWriter. 
-Collection ArrayList, Map...
-2D High-Dimensional Array.
-2D objec

2D object row max, row min, row col, row avg
Do this..

2D array or arrays
ArrayList You need to be able to use ArrayList Easiery since we dont know
how many we have in the file
so it will make out life easier.
