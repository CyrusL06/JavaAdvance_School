Write a Java program to print all permutations of a given String. For example, if given String is "GOD" then your program should print all 6 permutations of this string, e.g. "GOD," "OGD," "DOG," "GDO," "ODG," and "DGO." The string can be either given or input by the user. 

3!

GOD {1,2,3}  
DOG {3,2,1} -> 1,3 first and last
OGD {2,1,3} -> 1,2 first and middle
GDO { 1, 3, 2} 3,2 middle and last
ODG {2,3,1} -> 2,3,1 backward
DGO {3,1,2} -> 

1. Need to calculate how long the string is:
string.length() ??
if 3 then


2. Formula for permutation?... 
Need recursive until all patterns been used
as counter

{Put it into recursive }

3. You need to access index of string if
length = 4;


4. How can I swap them into non repeated way 
put the number in random??? but cant be repeated...

Vision:
Array is created having the 

1,2,3


stores in array and compared if it exit
[ {1,2,3} , {3,2,1}, {2,1,3},  { 1, 3, 2} , {2,3,1}, {3,1,2}]
